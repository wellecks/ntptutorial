    "\n",
    "Draft, Sketch, Prove was originally proposed using a proof assistant called [**Isabelle**](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Isabelle has two relevant properties that are helpful to introduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Declarative proofs\n",
    "First, many Isabelle proofs are structured as a sequence of intermediate conjectures (referred to as a *declarative proof*).\n",
    "For example, consider the proof below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "1. `c1`, which says that $1*28=n*4$\n",
    "2. `c2`, which says that $n=1*28/4$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step `then show ?thesis` can be thought of as \"the result follows\".\\\n",
    "Intuitively, intermediate conjectures can resemble steps in an informal (latex) proof. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Isabelle requires a proof of each step, shown in <span style=\"color:green\">**green**</span>. These often involve lower-level premises or calls to external automation.\\\n",
    "To obtain these proofs we can use Sledgehammer:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### 2. Sledgehammer\n",
    "\n",
    "Isabelle has a powerful automation tool called **[Sledgehammer](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2009-1/sledgehammer.html)** for producing proofs similar to those shown in green.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a user would write an intermediate conjecture, e.g. `have c1: \"...`, then call Sledgehammer to find a proof of the conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sledgehammer.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the covers, Sledgehammer calls out to classical provers that excel at short, low-level proofs. However, fully proving complex theorems with Sledgehammer is typically intractable due to the large search space (for instance, Sledgehammer wouldn't produce the `have c1` *statement*, even though it can prove the statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our use of Sledgehammer is implemented in the `Checker` class in `dsp_utils.py`. Please see [isabelle_setup.md](../isabelle_setup.md) to set up the proof checker, and modify the `working_dir`, `isa_path`, and `theory_file` paths below accordingly.\n",
